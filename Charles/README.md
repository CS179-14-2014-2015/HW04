#HW04 Bullet Fireworks  (deadline: 2015-01-06)

Write a "Bullet Hell" game (2d top-down shooter) with the following mechanics:

1. The player doesn't shoot.
2. The length of the level is fixed (at least one minute).
3. Scoring is based on how many times the player got hit (the lower the better).

For inspiration, take a look at Touhou games:

 * [Imperishable Night Extra Stage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nb5Ohbt1Sg) (speeded up till the bosses)
 * [Subterranean Animism Ultra Extra Stage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6o1pD4reRZE)

Or watch the New Year's fireworks for inspiration =①ω①=

I'm not very good at documentation

Anyway, I'm assuming our codes are kinda similar, so that it'll be easier to understand. :))

I spawned one "enemy" (it's movements are user-controlled, though).

Press ```SPACE``` to rotate the "enemy". Press the ```ARROW KEYS``` to move the it around the screen.

There are easy ways to change the number and frequency of the bullets being shot.

Just, um, yeah. Hopefully, it works on your computer. :))
