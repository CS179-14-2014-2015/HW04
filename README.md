#HW04 Bullet Fireworks  (deadline: 2015-01-06)

Write a "Bullet Hell" game (2d top-down shooter) with the following mechanics:

1. The player doesn't shoot.
2. The length of the level is fixed (at least one minute).
3. Scoring is based on how many times the player got hit (the lower the better).

For inspiration, take a look at Touhou games:

 * [Imperishable Night Extra Stage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nb5Ohbt1Sg) (speeded up till the bosses)
 * [Subterranean Animism Ultra Extra Stage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6o1pD4reRZE)

Or watch the New Year's fireworks for inspiration =①ω①=
